### What are the 3 things you love about TGIF?

Three things I love about TGIF are the strong bonding between members, the high quality meetings we organize and the spirit of learning by doing and having fun.

I joined TGIF in June 2014. For the past 8 years, I only had 5 absences. Friday night is always TGIF night, the night I release my stress and recharge myself.

### How has TGIF changed you?

TGIF’s tradition is high quality meetings. With that in mind, I prepare every assignment seriously, which further improves my public speaking skills. Through many officer roles I performed, I connected with members and earned many friendships.

During my TGIF President term, I received the 2020-2021 President’s Distinguished trophy. Back in 2014, I was a dual member of another Toastmasters Club and was awarded for excellent service as N3 Director 2017-2018. TGIF is the club where we grow with our stories, with love, fun and excellence. We will carry the torch and continue these three spirits for sure.
