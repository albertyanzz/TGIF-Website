Three things I love about TGIF are the strong bonding within members, the quality meeting we cultivate, the spirit of learning by doing and have fun.

I joined TGIF in June 2014, for the past 8 years, I have 5 absences. Friday night is always TGIF night, the night I released the stress and recharged myself.

TGIF tradition is to maintain quality meeting, with this, I prepare every assignment in a serious attitude, and further enhance public speaking skills. Through many officer roles I performed, I connected and cared members and won many friendships.

At my TGIF President term, I received 2020-2021 Presidentâ€™s Distinguished trophy. Back to 2014, I was dual member of other Toastmasters awarded as excellent service as N3 Director 2017-2018, TGIF is the club we grow with our stories with love, fun and excellence. We will carry the torch with these three spirits for sure.
