### What are the 3 things you love about TGIF?

Three things I love about TGIF:

1. I love the different individuals that God has brought into our club (s) of TGIF and Born to Shine, and how each person brings something special with the beauty He has placed in each person, both in the strength's, weaknesses, and imperfection.

2. I love the culture of our club, how each person strives to contribute their gifts and enthusiasm into this beautiful family, and the synergy of all of this working together.

3. I love seeing how our members grow, and discover, strengthen, and sharpen their God given talents.

### How has TGIF changed you?

TGIF has changed me to have more faith to realize when you step out to do something He wants you to do, He provides the resources, people, and talent to make it rewarding, beautiful, life changing, and fulfilling.
