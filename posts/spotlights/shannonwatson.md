### What are the 3 things you love about TGIF?

I joined TGIF in August 2015 and it has been one of the better decisions of my life. I was immediately accepted into the TGIF family and felt fully supported by my mentor Douglas Huang and all of the other members. I love that our members are warm and welcoming to everyone, that we are creative thinkers that share wonderful stories and try to challenge ourselves each time we are on stage.

### How has TGIF changed you?

I have grown so much during my almost 7 years in the club and this progress has also directly led to work successes as I gained more confidence with on-the-spot thinking and leadership skills. I have held the position of Treasurer for TGIF and I completed my Advanced Communicator Bronze (ACB). I am now finishing my Motivational Strategies Pathway.

If you are thinking about joining toastmasters, just do it, but also take the time to find the right club for you and your own path. Once you join I invite you to challenge yourself to do the hard things that will make you a better speaker and a more confident leader. Toastmasters is a supportive environment where it is safe to move out of your comfort zone because you have a team of cheerleaders there to help you grow
