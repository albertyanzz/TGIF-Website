### What are the 3 things you love about TGIF?

I joined TGIF Toastmasters in 2016 after I came back from my exchange year in the US. Since then, TGIF has been a priority on Friday night for me. There are 3Fs at TGIF that I love the most: Family, Friendship and Fun.

### How has TGIF changed you?

At TGIF, we care for each other like we are family members; we also goof around like we are friends, and most important of all is, you can have fun here! What could be better on a Friday night than a wonderful place like TGIF?
