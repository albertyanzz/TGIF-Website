### What are the 3 things you love about TGIF?

- The atmosphere
  Everyone comes together to support each other. It doesn't matter where you come from or what your background is. We don't judge, we give suggestions. We come together, and we grow together.

- The great people
  There are many talented speakers and leaders at TGIF. Listen to them for great advice on how to be a great speaker.

- The great meeting
  The opening songs at the beginning of the meeting always cheer everyone up. They inspire me to devote myself to the meeting. I am not afraid to improve myself. We are all here to grow together.

### How has TGIF changed you?

TGIF gives me the confidence to express myself in meetings. That energy inspires me. This isn't about me; it's about us. It's TGIF. Thank God Is Friday.
