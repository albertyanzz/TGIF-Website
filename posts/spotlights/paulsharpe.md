### What are the 3 things you love about TGIF?

There are many things I enjoy in TGIF and Born to Shine (BtS) Christian Toastmasters clubs. But the one thing I love: the people. Without a doubt, the people. We believe in TGIF and BtS that every person is a VIP Guest that God Himself sent. We love them as such. At the heart of TGIF Christian Toastmasters is the underlying belief that we are all children of the almighty God who sent His son Jesus to die on a cross for our sins and was raised on the third day to conquer death for all of us. If God so loved people. We must too.

The TGIF and (BtS) clubs are genuinely a group of people who are there for each other all the time. Not only in the club, but outside the club too. We support each other and stand up for each other always.

Words can never express the depth of my gratitude for how much these people mean to me and what they have done for me in my life. The support they have given me since Queenie got sick has been beyond belief. Without the love of TGIF and BtS, we would have been overwhelmed by the situation. Instead, the love and caring from the members overwhelmed us both.

### How has TGIF changed you?

Made me more confident, more open and more willing to engage positively with people. Definitely made me a better speaker, a more humble person and got me thinking much more about my faith and what it means to be a Christian. It has also changed the way I see people and interact with people.
