### What are the 3 things you love about TGIF?

I have been with TGIF since 2014. When I first joined, I was 25! Since joining, I have gotten to grow alongside many other members over the years. We share our stories and our lives together. TGIF is filled with amazing individuals who challenge me to be a better speaker and a better person. My time as an officer back in 2016-2017 especially helped me learn how to work with a team and give people space to explore their roles.

### How has TGIF changed you?

Over the years, the community at TGIF and Born to Shine has been here for me. I have felt so much love and support, even when I was in Japan for two years during the pandemic. I couldnâ€™t ask for a better club.
