### What are the 3 things you love about TGIF?

Atmosphere and inspiring speeches.

### How has TGIF changed you?

I feel unease with public speaking (I still am), but improved time by time.
TGIF provides me with a rather safe place to tolerate errors, and to feel alright being imperfect. It has given me the stage to share my stories and make me realize its power to spread opinions, love, and joy.
